# Big Forex Players MT5

This code represents the trading logic for the Big Forex Players MT5 system. It is a trading system that aims to take advantage of trading opportunities initiated by big players in the forex market. The code is written in MQL5 and can be used with the MetaTrader 5 platform.

The code defines several input parameters that can be adjusted by the user to enable or disable specific trading functions. These input parameters include:

- `positionsInitiatedByBanks`: This parameter determines whether positions initiated by banks should be considered for trading. If set to 1, the logic for checking positions initiated by banks will be executed.

- `positionsGeneratedByIndicators`: This parameter determines whether positions generated by indicators should be considered for trading. If set to 1, the logic for checking positions generated by indicators will be executed.

- `robotPositions`: This parameter determines whether positions generated by the trading robot should be considered for trading. If set to 1, the logic for checking robot positions will be executed.

- `futurePositionsByForexSignalsService`: This parameter determines whether positions generated by a Forex signals service should be considered for trading. If set to 1, the logic for checking positions generated by the Forex signals service will be executed.

The code also defines several trading functions that are executed at different stages of the trading process:

- `Init()`: This function is called during the initialization of the trading system. It initializes the system and performs necessary tasks such as loading and configuring indicators and connecting to a Forex signals service if enabled.

- `Deinit()`: This function is called during the deinitialization of the trading system. It performs any necessary cleanup tasks before the system is shut down.

- `OnTick()`: This function is called on each tick of the market. It is the main trading logic of the system and checks if the trading conditions are met for each enabled trading function. If a specific trading function is enabled, the corresponding logic is executed.
